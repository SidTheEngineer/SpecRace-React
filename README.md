# SpecRace (React)

A better, React/Redux implementation of the already created SpecRace. This project takes advantage of `create-react-app` and the scripts that come along with such. `react-router` is used to now provide routing and deep linking throughout the application.

##The Plan
This project will eventually replace the up and running specrace.com. The ultimate goal with this project's creation is to become comfortable working with React and Redux, as well as to eventually learn and implement isomorphic JavaScript. 

#####External API URLs/Keys
`exampleConfig.json` is where necessary API keys and URLs should be for the application to work. This is referenced as `config.json` in the code.
