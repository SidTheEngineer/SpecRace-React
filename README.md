# SpecRace (React)

A better, React/Redux implementation of the already created SpecRace. 

"exampleConfig.json" is referenced as "config.json" in the code, and is the location where URLs and API keys should be. However, in production, the URLs/API keys will not be passed to the front end, and requests to the external API will be handled in server code
