# SpecRace (React)

A better, React/Redux implementation of the already created SpecRace. This project takes advantage of `create-react-app` and the scripts that come along with such

##The Plan
This project will eventually replace the up and running specrace.com. The ultimate goal with this project's creation is to become comfortable working with React and Redux, as well as to eventually learn and implement isomorphic JavaScript. 

#####External API URLs/Keys
`exampleConfig.json` is referenced as `config.json` in the code, and is the location where URLs and API keys should be. However, in production, the URLs/API keys will not be passed to the front end, and requests to the external API will be handled in server code
